# Composers
### [This is an old, archived project. It was once available in the iOS App Store, but it has not been maintained recently and temporarily removed. In 2021, we restarted this project. ]

Remember the music scores of that year? The classics of the year have returned. This time we have added more gameplay and scores. In addition, we have also optimized the interface of Composers to make it more suitable for the rhythm of 2021!

Composers is an application for non-tonal music theory students. It can generate an interactive matrix based on a given set of tonal classes. Then, it provides
Visual cues and other analysis tools used.
